# EEG-Based Real-Time Diagnostic Tools at Eonum AG

## Internship Summary: Jun 2025- Aug 2025

**Role:** Research/Data Science Intern  
**Organization:** Eonum Inc. Irvine, California 

## Overview

During my internship at Eonum AG, I worked on developing and optimizing real-time AI algorithms for EEG-based psychiatric diagnosis. The goal was to advance low-latency, wearable-compatible solutions to support continuous patient monitoring and clinical decision-making.

## Key Contributions

- **AI-Driven Classification:** Developed and validated supervised learning models (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting) for real-time classification of EEG signals, focusing on quantum potential and p-adic entropy features.
- **Data Pipeline Automation:** Designed end-to-end data processing pipelines for EEG matrices, including raw `.mat` file parsing, windowing, and conversion to analysis-ready formats (`.csv`).
- **Feature Engineering:** Implemented advanced feature extraction methods to capture clinically relevant EEG patterns and enhance model accuracy.
- **Clinical Integration:** Collaborated with interdisciplinary teams to translate research findings into actionable prototypes for wearable EEG devices and real-time diagnostic tools.
- **Research Impact:** Presented results and technical recommendations to engineers and clinicians, supporting Eonum’s mission to bridge research and clinical application in mental health.

## Skills & Tools Utilized

- Python, MATLAB, Pandas, NumPy
- Machine Learning (scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Signal Processing, Feature Engineering
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Cross-functional collaboration, Agile research environment

## Outcome

This internship strengthened my expertise in applied machine learning, real-time signal processing, and interdisciplinary teamwork. The developed pipelines and algorithms contributed to Eonum’s efforts in advancing AI-powered solutions for healthcare.
